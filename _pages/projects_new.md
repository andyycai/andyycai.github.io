**Overview:** I am currently working as a research assistant under the supervision of <a href="https://comp.anu.edu.au/people/ahad-zehmakan/">Dr Ahad N. Zehmakan </a>. During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a summer research student under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahrh0/">Dr Rosemary J. Harris </a> in summer 2021 and then stayed on with her to complete my undergraduate dissertation in spring 2022.

**Majority Opinion Diffusion Models** supervised by <a href="https://comp.anu.edu.au/people/ahad-zehmakan/">Dr Ahad N. Zehmakan </a>

<ul>
  <li>This project will mainly focus on investigating the majority model (and its variants) on the random and expander graphs and different graph models which mimic the real-world social networks.</li>
  <li>The goal of this project is to study the following questions, from both a theoretical and practical perspective: 1. Stabilisation time and period of the majority process; 2. Minimum size of a winning set; 3. Random initial colouring.</li>
  <li>To be continued...</li>

**Record Statistics for Stock Prices** supervised by <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahrh0/">Dr Rosemary J. Harris </a>

<ul>
  <li>This project mainly focused on investigating the statistical properties of extreme events in stochastic processes.</li>
  <li>We investigated the exact result and asymptotic approximation of record statistics properties for three different cases of discrete time series: 1. Sequence of i.i.d. random variables; 2. Random walk with symmetric and continuous jump distribution; 3. Biased Gaussian random walk. We presented all theoretical findings in full details with our simulations.</li>
  <li>We further discussed the connections between the statistics of records in real-world financial data and our results. We summarised that the record statistics of historical stock prices, within the scope of our discussions, were well-described by a biased Gaussian random walk with constant drift speed 0.075, while better realisation would be feasible with more complicated models.</li>

**Random Walkers with Extreme Value Memory: Modelling the Peak-End Rule** supervised by <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahrh0/">Dr Rosemary J. Harris </a>

<ul>
  <li>This project mainly focused on reviewing and extending the findings published by Dr Rosemary J. Harris in her recent research paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03499.pdf"><i>'Random walkers with extreme value memory: modelling the peak-end rule'</i></a>.</li>
  <li>We considered a random walk model which was inspired by the psychological heuristic on the “peak-end rule” for remembered experience, where the probability of moving left or right depends on the maximum value of a random variable associated to each time step and the noise level in the decision. In particular, we used this framework to investigate whether increased noise in the model always leads to more switching between decisions.</li>
  <li>We discussed the possible finite-time effects and different classes of long-time behaviour, by employing different distributions of past experience and the characteristic largest value from the extreme value theory, and compare the predictions with simulations.</li>
