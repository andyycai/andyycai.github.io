I am an **MSc student in Mathematical Sciences** at the University of Oxford. Prior to joining Oxford, I obtained my **BSc (Hons) in Mathematical Sciences** at Queen Mary University of London in 2022.

I am currently working on a research project regarding Majority Opinion Diffusion Models, supervised by <a href="https://comp.anu.edu.au/people/ahad-zehmakan/">Dr Ahad N. Zehmakan</a>. During my undergraduate studies, I was very fortunate to complete my summer research project and undergraduate dissertation under the supervision of <a href='https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahrh0/'>Dr Rosemary J. Harris</a>.

**I am actively looking for a PhD position commencing in 2024/25.**
